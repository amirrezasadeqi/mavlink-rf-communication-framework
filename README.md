# mavlink-rf-communication-framework

This is a framework providing some infrastructures for simpler communication of two linux systems via mavlink protocol. Using this framework you can define tasks for each mavlink message types recieved on different systems. Also, you can filter which ROS messages to be sent through communication link and furthermore to which ROS message type we should convert recieved mavlink message and also what data we should publish in ROS network. Also, There useful utility functions and classes for conversion between mavlink and ROS messages.

At the moment it is only tested on Digi international 9XTend modules.
